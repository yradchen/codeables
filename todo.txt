Don't allow users with same username but diff capitalization to create accounts.
Push onto header 'We're sorry, we couldn't find that one!' when trying to go to a page that doesn't exist/shouldn't be accessed

redux state - in the store
dispatch an action to the store to toggle visibility of you.




New Codeable schema
title - presence true
description - no presence check
cover_img - no presence check
visible - true/false (changes when publish is hit.) default false

Go to the title page, enter a title and hit create codeable, this creates a codeable with just the title. This takes you to a page which displays the codeable and lets you click a button to add steps. Also has a publish button (publish button toggles visble from false to true. Can't be toggled true unless title, description and image are present.)

Clicking on one of the steps or projets takes you to it's edit page where you can change the image or text. Save button is located here. When you hit save button this portion hits the database.
